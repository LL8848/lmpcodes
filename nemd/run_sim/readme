Procedure to carry out a series of nemd simulations:

-------- file preparation -----------

1. create a folder for a temperature, say /343K

2. copy the 'nemd_batch.sh' from existing cases to here

3. change the values of temperature and density in the file /343K/nemd_batch.sh

4. copy the 'input' folder from exiting cases to that folder: cp xx/input xx/343K/input

5. modify the node infomation in the file /343K/input/sb_nemd.sh

6. add "0 0 0 xy xz yz" to the data file to make the box triclinic.

-------- execution -----------

change the values in the "shearList" in the /343K/nemd_batch.sh to set the shear rates to simulate

1. run for 1 rate, check everything is all right

2. run the rest
